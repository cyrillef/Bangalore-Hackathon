This ZombieViewer written in JS for webGL using three.js framework.

This simple viewer reads OBJ file along with its associated textures
and loads onto HTML web.


I didnt find a possible way to load .MTL file which gives the material properties.

This OBJ file created from Autodesk FBXtoOBJ converter.
