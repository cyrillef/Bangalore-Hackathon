This ZombieViewer written in JS for webGL using three.js framework.

This simple viewer reads OBJ file along with its associated textures
and loads onto HTML web.


I didnt find a possible way to load .MTL file which gives the material properties.

This OBJ file created from Autodesk FBXtoOBJ converter.

Instructions :

. Download entire Zombie folder
. Load HTML on Firefox ,on other web browsers its bit difficult
. To avoid choppy screen ,disable hardware acceleration on firefox
. You can disable from Options in Firefox.
